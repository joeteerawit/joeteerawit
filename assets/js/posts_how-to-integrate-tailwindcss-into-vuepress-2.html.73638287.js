Whether you’re a developer working on a web project or simply prototyping layouts, you may often need to generate placeholder text (commonly referred to as “Lorem Ipsum“). In this article, we’ll explore how to easily generate Lorem Ipsum text directly within VS Code using various methods.</p><p>What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is placeholder text commonly used in the design, printing, and typesetting industries. It is a pseudo-Latin text that is not meant to be read, but serves as a filler to demonstrate how text will look in a design layout.</p><p>Now, let’s dive into how you can create Lorem Ipsum text in VS Code.</p><p>Methods to Create Lorem Text in VS Code</p><ol><li>Using Emmet Abbreviations (Built-in)</li></ol><p>Emmet is a powerful feature built directly into VS Code that allows you to quickly generate text and code snippets. One of its lesser-known abilities is the ability to generate Lorem Ipsum text.</p><p>Here’s how to use Emmet to generate Lorem text:</p><p>Open a File in VS Code: Create or open an HTML or any other text-based file. Type lorem in the editor: Simply type the word lorem. Press Tab or Enter: VS Code will expand the word lorem into a paragraph of Lorem Ipsum text. By default, this will generate a paragraph of about 30 words. If you want to generate more or fewer words, you can modify the number as follows:</p><p>Example: Typing lorem50 and pressing Tab will generate 50 words of Lorem Ipsum. Pros:</p><p>No extensions are required. Simple and fast. Cons:</p><p>Limited to certain file types where Emmet is active (e.g., HTML, CSS, etc.). 2. Using the “Lorem ipsum” Extension</p><p>VS Code has an extensive marketplace with various extensions, including one specifically designed to generate Lorem Ipsum text. Here’s how to install and use it:</p><p>Install the Extension: Open the VS Code Marketplace by clicking on the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X). Search for “Lorem ipsum” by Tyler Long. Click Install. 2. Generate Lorem Text:</p><p>Open any file where you want to insert Lorem Ipsum text. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette. Type Insert Lorem Ipsum and select the command from the list. Lorem Ipsum text will be inserted at your cursor’s location. Pros:</p><p>Easy to use. Works in any file type. You can choose the number of paragraphs or words. Cons:</p><p>Requires installation of an extension. 3. Using Snippets</p><p>You can also create a custom snippet in VS Code to generate Lorem Ipsum text. This is a great option if you frequently need to generate Lorem text and want a custom approach.</p><p>Here’s how to create a snippet for Lorem Ipsum:</p><p>Open the Snippet Configuration: Go to File &gt; Preferences &gt; User Snippets. Select the language for which you want to create the snippet, e.g., HTML, Markdown, etc. 2. Add the Snippet:</p><p>Add the following JSON code to your snippet file: json { &quot;Insert Lorem Ipsum&quot;: { &quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;lorem&quot;, &quot;body&quot;: [ &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.&quot; ], &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Generates a block of Lorem Ipsum text.&quot; } } Save the file. 3. Use the Snippet:</p><p>Type lorem in the editor and press Tab to insert your custom Lorem Ipsum text. Pros:</p><p>Fully customizable. Available in specific language modes. Cons:</p><p>Requires manual setup. Conclusion VS Code offers multiple methods to generate Lorem Ipsum text efficiently. Whether you prefer the built-in Emmet abbreviations, an extension, or a custom snippet, you can choose the approach that best suits your workflow. For quick and occasional use, Emmet is often sufficient, while those who need more control may prefer extensions or custom snippets.</p><p>By following the steps outlined above, you’ll be able to integrate Lorem Ipsum into your coding process seamlessly and enhance your productivity when building or designing projects.</p><p>FAQs</p><ol><li>What is Lorem Ipsum used for?</li></ol><p>Lorem Ipsum is used as placeholder text in design and web development to simulate real content.
